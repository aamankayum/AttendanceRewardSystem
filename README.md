## 🌟 Features

- **Register Students**: ➕ Add students to the system.
- **Mark Attendance**: ✔️ Record attendance updates.
- **Issue Rewards**: 🏅 Automatically issue reward messages when attendance thresholds are met.
- **Update Requirements**: 🔄 Modify the attendance requirement dynamically.

## 🛠️ Future Scope
There are exciting future possibilities for the AttendanceRewardSystem:

- **Token Rewards**: 🎟️ Implement a token system where students receive tokens as rewards for high attendance. These tokens can be used for various in-school purchases.
- **Redeemable Tokens**: 🛒 Allow tokens to be redeemed within the school for items such as food from the canteen, stationery, or other supplies. This feature can further incentivize students to maintain high attendance.
